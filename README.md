üì¶ Swire Coca-Cola Capstone Project
University of Utah ‚Äì MSBA | Spring 2025 | Team 8

üîç Project Summary
Swire Coca-Cola uses two primary delivery methods: ARTM (white truck) for low-volume customers and red truck (direct delivery) for high-volume customers. However, some ARTM customers are showing strong growth, while many red truck accounts remain stagnant. Additionally, frequent low-volume orders increase delivery costs and reduce operational efficiency.

Our goal was to apply machine learning and analytics to:

Identify high-growth customers on ARTM who should remain on red truck delivery to support future revenue.

Encourage bulk ordering to reduce delivery frequency and cost.

Activate Sales Reps to drive engagement and conversion to direct delivery.

üíº Business Value & Results
Cost Savings: Reducing average deliveries per customer from 232 to 100/year could cut delivery costs by 56.6%, saving $380 per customer annually.

Revenue Growth: Targeting just 5% of Sales Rep customers for conversion could generate $130M in new revenue and $39M in annual profit.

Efficiency Gains: Customer segmentation and delivery modeling empower Swire to realign routes and optimize fulfillment based on growth potential and channel behavior.

‚úÖ Sponsor Takeaway
This solution provides Swire with a scalable, data-backed framework to optimize delivery routes, retain high-growth accounts, and increase profitability‚Äîall while improving the customer experience.
