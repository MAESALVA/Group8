ðŸ§© Business Problem Statement
Swire Coca-Colaâ€™s delivery network operates on a two-route model: ARTM (white truck) for low-volume customers and direct delivery (red truck) for higher-volume accounts. However, this static classification overlooks the future potential of some ARTM customers. Transitioning high-growth customers to ARTM too early risks stifling their expansion and losing long-term revenue, while keeping low-growth customers on red truck routes drives up unnecessary delivery costs. At the same time, many customers place frequent, low-volume orders, leading to excessive delivery trips and inflated logistics costs. To address these challenges, Swire seeks a data-driven solution that identifies high-potential customers on ARTM who warrant red truck service, while also encouraging bulk ordering behaviors to reduce delivery frequency. The ultimate goal is to balance logistics efficiency with customer growth by making smarter routing and engagement decisions based on predictive analytics.
