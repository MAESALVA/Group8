ðŸ§© Business Problem Statement
Swire Coca-Cola faces a strategic challenge in balancing delivery cost efficiency with customer growth potential. The company utilizes two primary delivery modes: ARTM (white truck) for low-volume customers and red truck (direct delivery) for higher-volume accounts. However, a subset of customers currently on ARTM routes are exhibiting signs of accelerated growth. Prematurely transitioning these customers to cost-driven ARTM delivery may hinder long-term revenue opportunities. Conversely, maintaining stagnant or low-potential customers on red truck routes unnecessarily inflates operational costs.

Additionally, many customers place frequent, low-volume orders, further straining delivery efficiency and driving up cost-to-serve. Swire lacks a systematic framework to (1) identify which ARTM customers have high growth potential and should remain on direct delivery, and (2) encourage behavioral shifts toward bulk ordering to optimize logistics.

To address these issues, a data-driven solution is needed to enhance route assignment, reduce delivery frequency, and enable proactive sales engagement that aligns with both operational goals and customer expansion.
